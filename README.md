Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It defines a strongly-typed-schema, with default values and schema validations which are later mapped to a MongoDB document.

As you all are aware that mongoose has removed callback function for certain functions (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/migrating_to_7.html).

In this documentaion there will be only practical things about CRUD operations to be performed in latest version of Mongoose (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose).

You can convert your previous version code i.e. Synchronous code to Asynchronous code using this tool (https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/tools/callback-to-async-await). This will convert callbacks to Asynchronous or Await functions using OpenAI.
